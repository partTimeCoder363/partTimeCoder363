- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @partTimeCoder363. Why am I here? I was advised by a Doctor that the best way to avoid demetia was to learn another language. Spanish, German and French seemed a little
     too main stream. So I chose "Javascript"!!!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all aspexts of web development.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to get my head around javascript: No easy task as I've discovered!!!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ...
